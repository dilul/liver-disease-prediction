# Exploring Biochemical Markers for Liver Disease Diagnosis using Machine Learning

This study explores the use of machine learning algorithms, namely K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network, to predict liver diseases efficiently. Furthermore, this study analyses the clinical features using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
